## 👋 Welcome

I’m **Tinashe Millicent**, a data-driven professional with a passion for turning information into insight. With a background in IT and data analysis, I enjoy solving real-world problems using structured thinking, analytics, and machine learning tools.

In my free time, you'll find me relaxing with anime or diving into a new book — always learning, always exploring.
